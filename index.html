		<p class="first">A while back Radiohead open sourced their <i>House of Cards</i> music video data in the form of CSV files. The CSV files contain <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> coordinates for the points in each frame of the video. These points were captured with a special combination of lasers and sensors &#8212; more technically, the video data was collected with <a class="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">LiDAR</a> technology. In this case, their LiDAR &ldquo;camera&rdquo; scanned 360&deg; and had 64 individual lasers. Sensors retrieved the data and the scene was reconstructed in software. The production team also incorporated glass and mirrors to give the music video a distorted look (note the errant particles):</p>

		<p>The video data currently lives in a GitHub repository. The nature of the data has lent itself well to reconstructing the video with programs like <i>Processing</i>. There may also be some <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/OpenAVR/radiohead-vr">VR applications</a>. With the video data freely available, I was able to take the very first frame of the video (thousands and thousands of points) and render it as a particle system in the browser using <i>three.js</i>, a 3D JavaScript library. As someone who took a computer graphics course in college, I can appreciate how much simpler three.js made working with WebGL. I gave the demo trackball controls such that the particle system could be explored from all angles and distances.</p>

		<p>I've always been interested in the methods behind this music video. As far as I know, it's the only music video to use realtime 3D recording. The vibe of the video fits in perfectly with the theme(s) from <i>In Rainbows</i> and I'd say the director put it well:</p>

		<blockquote><p id="block-quote"><i>&ldquo;In a weird way it's a direct reflection of kind've where we are in society &#8212; everything is data &hellip; It seems like our lives are digital and so in that sense it definitely felt apt.&rdquo;</i></p></blockquote>







		<p>This demo can be rotated, panned, and zoomed with the usual touch gestures, or by dragging and scrolling with a mouse if you're on a desktop.</p>
